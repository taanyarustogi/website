                    <h4>LabSpencer</h4>
                    <p>In year 1 semester 2, in our Engineering Strategies and Practices course we were divided into groups 
                    of 6 people and given a client and a problem statement. Throughout the course we had to go through the design 
                    process where we created a problem statement, went through the stalkeholders, contraints, objectives and more. 
                    All of which is outlined in the document linked below. The client for this project were engineering lab technicians 
                    and the problem was that students usually dispense more than the required 2 gloves which creates the extra 
                    gloves to be contaminated and therefore be wasted. In this project, I used fusion360 to create a to scale 
                    design of our glove dispenser idea. We then 3D printed the dispenser and used it in our presentation to simulate
                    the solution.</p>

                    <h4>TinyMile</h4>
                    <p>In year 1 semester 1, in our Engineering Strategies and Practices course we were divided into groups
                    of 6 people and given a client and a problem statement. Throughout the course we had to go through the design
                    process where we created a problem statement, went through the stalkeholders, contraints, objectives and more.
                    All of which is outlines in the document linked below. The client for this project was the company Tiny Mile that
                    creates food delivery robots and the problem was that since the robot is small, costumers have to bend down to 
                    pick up the food from inside the robot. We had to design a mechanism for the food to be elevated from the robot 
                    to the costumer. In this project, I collaborated with my teammates to create 50 designs and then use multiple 
                    methods to narrow it down to one idea and design the mechanisms and components of that idea.

                    <h4>No Touch Disinfectant Wipes Dispenser</h4>
                    <p>In grade 12, during covid since all schooling was moved online, I along with other peers from all over the world competed 
                    in an online hackathon, the theme of which was to create a project that helps lessen the spread of Covid-19. The project
                    that I decided on creating is a disinfectant wipes dispenser that is touch-free and uses an ultrasonic sensor along with an 
                    arduino coded in python to sense the users hand waving which moves a motor. The motor is connected to a rod which is connected
                    to a roll of disinfectant wipes that unrolls when the motor moves. Whilst completing this project, I learned not only how to use
                    hardware components such as breadboards and arduinos but also how to code in python as that is what was required when working
                    with arduinos. </p>

                    <h4>Child Tracker - 3D printed</h4>
                    <p>In grade 9 and 10 as part of my IGCSE certification I completed a Design and Technology: Systems and Controls 
                    course where we created a couple of projects whilst learning about structures, electronics and mechanism. We 
                    made and tested a bridge, synthesizer and an automata. As a part of my final project I made a two piece child
                    tracker which send signals to each other and see the strength of the signal. When the signal's strength
                    is weaker than a certain amount, the parent part of the child tracker shows a cross indicating that the child is far from 
                    the parents where otherwise the tracker shows a check mark. The child part of the child tracker starts emmiting a
                    noise when the signal's strength is less than a certain amount making it easier for the parent to find the child. 
                    For this project, I used two MicroBits and 3D printed the bodies of the child trackers after making them on fusion.</p>

                    <h4>Reversi Lab</h4>
                    <p>In first year of university semester two we did a course learning C programming which was our first 
                        programming course. At the end of the semester our final project was to code a computer opponent for the game 
                        reversi or othello, attached is the github link for the code used. In this code, the user chooses the 
                        dimensions for a square othello board and a text-based image of the board is shown. The user then choses which 
                        color the computer plays and the game starts with the computer asking the user to input a letter coordinate 
                        and the computer printing the board. The computer then plays its move and prints the board with its move shown. 
                        This continues until no more moves can be made and the computer determines who wins. If the user makes an invalid 
                        move, the computer prints out 'invalid move' and the game ends there.

                    <h4>Piston</h4>
                    <p>During year 2 semester one I did an out-of-school weekend machining course which lasted Saturday and Sunday 9am to 6pm.
                        We used numerous industrial machines such as a drill press to make holes in the metal plate and a metal lathe mill to 
                        cut the metal into the shapes required such as the the cylinder and the piston and grinding machines to finish the 
                        project. Through this project I also got experience in using different measuring tools such as calipers, height guages, 
                        dial guages and more.

                    <h4>NoomNoom Useless Robot</h4>
                    <p>I participated on a 48 hour overnight makeathon at UofT where in a group of 3 students we were given the choice of making
                        an object to do with one of three themes given using material that we could order in a kind-of shop. The theme we chose
                        was to compete in was useless inventions. We first started by thinking of different ideas of things we could make and 
                        landed on a robot that 'eats' everything you put on its hand. From there we created the first draft of Noomnoom out of paper
                        and cardboard. After finalising that we created the structure on Fusion360 and sent it to get 3D printed. We then worked on
                        the electronic, noomnoom works with an arduino connected to the ultrasonic sensor that senses the user's hand and a servo motor
                        then moves the head and arm. We also connected noom noom to a set of wheels so it can do a little 'dance'. After 48 tiresome hours
                        we ended up with Noomnoom as the final product!
